# stock-analysis with VBA

##Overview

This goal of this project was to refractor an Excel VBA code, made to collect stock information over the course of two years and determine if these stocks are worth the investment. This code was completed in a similar format, but we want to increase the efficiency of our coding.

The Data utilyzed for this project includes two spreadsheets with metrics on 12 different stocks. These are for 2017 and 2018.

Refractoring the code made our coding much cleaner and more organized. The efficiency was the true goal, however, and it more than exceeded expectations. The original analysis took about a second to run, while the new code took only a fourth of the time. This speaks for itself. Refactoring was an absolute success.
